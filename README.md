# Booker For Chrome

This extensions basic code comes from the, now deprecated, Google Calender for Chrome extension by [Manas Tungare](https://github.com/manastungare).

## Project Goals

There are many forks of the original project, some are exact copies, while some take a twist. The goal of this project is to take features for video calls and/or (settings page) be able to join calls, or even open google maps depending on the location of the event.

## Original License

Manas Tungare officially encourages the code to be cloned, modified or kept stock, and distributed under other parties names. This is also explicitly allowed in the Apache 2 License he has chosen.
